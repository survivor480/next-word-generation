# Story Generator Model (From Scratch)

## Overview

This project aims to build a **story generator model** from scratch without using prebuilt models. The model will take a user prompt and generate a coherent story using deep learning techniques.

## Roadmap

### **Phase 1: Understanding Language Models**

* Learn about RNNs, LSTMs, and Transformers.
* Study text tokenization and embeddings.
* Understand sequence modeling and attention mechanisms.

### **Phase 2: Dataset Collection & Preprocessing**

* Collect datasets:
  * BookCorpus (Free novels)
  * Project Gutenberg (Public domain books)
  * Reddit WritingPrompts (Prompt-based stories)
* Preprocess text:
  * Tokenization using Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) or WordPiece.
  * Remove special characters and clean text.
  * Chunk long text into manageable sequences.

### **Phase 3: Implementing the Core Model**

#### **Option 1: LSTM-based Model**

* Build an **Embedding Layer** to convert words into dense vectors.
* Implement an **LSTM layer** for sequence modeling.
* Use a **Dense layer** for word prediction.

#### **Option 2: Transformer-based Model**

* Implement  **Multi-Head Self-Attention** .
* Use **Positional Encoding** to retain word order.
* Build a **Decoder Model** for text generation.

### **Phase 4: Training & Optimization**

* Use **CrossEntropyLoss** for token prediction.
* Optimize with  **AdamW** .
* Implement **Gradient Clipping** to stabilize training.
* Train using GPUs for better performance.

### **Phase 5: Generating Stories**

* Implement different text generation strategies:
  * **Greedy Search** (Basic, lacks diversity)
  * **Beam Search** (Balances quality and diversity)
  * **Top-k & Top-p Sampling** (Best for creativity)

### **Phase 6: Evaluation & Fine-Tuning**

* Measure **Perplexity Score (PPL)** for fluency.
* Compare outputs with  **BLEU Score** .
* Use human feedback for qualitative evaluation.

### **Phase 7: Deployment**

* Deploy as an **API** using FastAPI or Flask.
* Build a **web interface** with React.
* Host on  **AWS Lambda, Hugging Face Spaces, or a custom server** .
